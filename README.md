# portfolio-website

This is a portfolio website created to highlight some of the cool projects I have developed

## Description

This website will be made by utilizing webpack, DOM Manipulation techniques, and SOLID design principles to create a portfolio website with a minamilistic and sleek UI. 
It is also a site for recruiters to have a look at my skills that I have developed while following The Odin Project Curriculum and to see a side of myself that a resume cannot capture.
